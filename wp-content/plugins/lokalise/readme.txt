Simplify WordPress website translation and multilingual content management with Lokalise.

== Description ==
Set up a continuous, automated, and streamlined localization process for your multi language WordPress websites and blogs. By integrating WordPress and Lokalise, you gain access to a modern translation management system with robust functionalities.

Using Lokalise to manage localization processes leads to faster launches, fewer errors, and savings on translation budgets. Here are some of the features that make this possible:

* Machine translation suggestions for rapid results
* Translation memory (TM) that stores your previous translations and helps improve consistency, as well as reducing translation costs and turnaround time
* Comments and chat for the whole project or a particular translation
* Powerful filter and search functionalities on multiple levels (string, status, language, etc.)
* Automated notifications when certain actions are completed
* And many more.

Lokalise is a collaborative translation platform which means you can work with your team and external partners, creating a single source of truth for all your translation projects.
